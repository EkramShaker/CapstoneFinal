Overview
CodeBrew Cafe is a coffee shop web application that allows users to browse a menu of coffee drinks, place orders, and manage their account. The project showcases a complete MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), demonstrating both frontend and backend development skills.

Technologies Used
1. Frontend
React:

Used to build a responsive and dynamic user interface.
Components like Header, Menu, Orders, and Footer were created to organize the UI.
React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for state management and lifecycle methods.
React Router:

For navigating between different pages (Home, Menu, Orders, About Us).


Axios:
Used to handle HTTP requests for communicating with the backend API.

Vite:
Chosen as the setup tool for its fast development server and build process.

CSS:
Custom styles were used to achieve a consistent, coffee-themed look throughout the app.
Separate CSS files for each component (Header.css, Menu.css, Orders.css, etc.).
Animations (e.g., spinning logo) and media queries for responsiveness.
Custom styles for buttons, form elements, and navigation links.

HTML5/CSS3:
For structuring and styling the application.
Semantic HTML elements used to improve accessibility.

2. Backend

Node.js:
The server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.

Express:
To set up the server and define RESTful routes for the backend.
Middleware for handling requests and responses, including authentication.

MongoDB & Mongoose:
MongoDB as the database to store user information, orders, and menu items.
Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to interact with MongoDB, define schemas, and handle database operations.

Nodemailer:
Used for sending confirmation emails when an order is placed (future enhancement).

3. User Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Token):
Used for secure authentication and authorization.
Tokens are generated upon successful login and are verified for protected routes.

4. State Management
React Context API:
Used to manage global state (e.g., user authentication state, orders).
OrderContext was created to provide order management functionality across components.

5. APIs
Custom Backend API:
Created using Express.js to handle various functionalities:
POST /api/auth/login - Login user.
POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/logout - Logout user.
POST /api/orders - Place a new order.
GET /api/orders - Fetch all orders (for admin users).
GET /api/orders/user - Fetch orders for a specific user.
Integration with External APIs (Future Enhancement):

Plan to integrate with payment gateways like Stripe for order payment processing.

6. Version Control
Git & GitHub:
Version control for tracking changes, managing branches, and collaborating.
README file, issues, and pull requests for project documentation.
